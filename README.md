## Installation
Get the CSS Code by clicking on the names in the README or click on the files with the name + .css on top of the page\
Now there are 2 ways to put the CSS in your spicetify
### Way 1
use the [CSS-Editor Extension](https://github.com/FlafyDev/spotify-css-editor) (recommended)
### Way 2
go in the "Snippets"-tab in the marketplace, click "+ Add CSS" in the right bottom corner and put the code in "Custom CSS" and give it a name and description (preferebly the name & description i used)
